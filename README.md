# flickr-gallery

Project description
Create a photo gallery by using the Flickr API, https://www.flickr.com/services/api/.

How I approached the brief
I started with reading the documentation thoroughly. Then I created a mobile first structure in HTML and CSS of how I wanted the photos to be shown. When that was done I started with the fetch and got the photos in the place I wanted to. Then I styled it more and implemented some features, like the accordion, sticky header and scroll to top button.

Things I would have done if I had more time
If I had more time I would use Redux for saving the data from the API. I would implement a hover effect on the images showing more content to every image when hover (for example title and a link to the image on Flickr).
