# flickr-gallery

Project description: 
Create a photo gallery by using the Flickr API, https://www.flickr.com/services/api/.

How I approached the brief: 
I started with reading the documentation thoroughly. Then I created a mobile first structure in HTML and CSS of how I wanted the image grid to be. When that was done I started with the fetch. A challenge was to think of a way to approach the images, when all of them came in different sizes â€“ and still will do when users upload more. After a lot of different approaches I came up with a way to make the grid look decent, but when I get more time I will continue to work on it to improve even more.

Further improvements I would like to do:
I would like to go for another round on the gallery images and optimize the grid. I would like to implement a hover effect on the images, so when the user hovers the image fades and display the image title. I would like to store the data from the API by using Redux.
